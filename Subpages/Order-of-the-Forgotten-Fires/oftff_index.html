            <p>History has been marked by numerous conflicts between the various races of the mortal realm. The wars are often brutal, costly, and not always fair in their execution. The humans, the race with the most drive and a heart ripe for corruption, are often the people giving into the unnatural methods of maintaining their power. So far, it has served them well.</p>
            
            <p>Through long centuries of bloodied conflicts, the humans have an iron fist over the southern half of the central continent. After driving the Elves off the continent in the last great war, the humans have dwelt with little resistance. The other races have been banished to smaller colonies to the north.</p>
            
            <p>The divines have been busy in the course of history, all having a stake in the outcome. When civil war broke out in the divine realm, many minor gods in control of smaller peoples lost their divinities. A member of the triad orchestrated a grand betrayal and changed the entire dynamic of the godly realm.</p>
            
            <p>Mortals, humans especially, have often communicated with nefarious gods with the promises of favor and power. The Order of the Calcifers is chief amongst them, looking to resurrect the evil god, Karagur, who wishes to resurrect himself through the power of the five great touchstones - divine objects given by the goddess of order, Elona.</p>
            
            <p>The Order succeeded once, leading to the destruction of Narnclaedra, the tower where the touchstone in the whole form resided, and the murder of the five wizards tasked with ensuring its safety. Now, with the shards of the touchstone scattered around the land, various powers are attempting to reassert themselves in the mortal realm. The balance is still in question. It's only a matter of time.</p>
