_Sydol&#39;s Light – Chapter 3_

        Tyra could just make out Darnia&#39;s stammered expression from the curtain hanging from above the doorway. His large hands pressed flat against the surface of the countertop while the rest of his body stiffened so much that his eyebrows began to twitch. There was no way to know if and what he saw of the figure, but it was enough to petrify him. His mouth hung open but neither breath nor sound passed through him. She could see Darnia&#39;s eyes directed down by where his hands would be but the body of the aggressor blocked it from her sight. She nearly coughed on swallowing the tension. She felt it fall like a rock, cracking against the pit of her stomach.

        _It could be a blaster._

        Her breath hitched and her head dropped. Her attention on the figure shifted to Q-DO&#39;s lengthening eyestalk carefully passing between the fold in the curtains. She glanced back. She glanced back down. She dropped to her knees, settling herself closer to him.

        &quot;Can you see what he&#39;s holding?&quot; she whispered. She had her head turned back towards the storage room behind them when she spoke.

        Q-DO hummed.

        She pulled her head back. An incredulous look captured her features. &quot;You can hear them?&quot;

        He responded affirmatively. The click of a component folding out towards her followed. If it didn&#39;t risk exposing them, she would have groaned at the display. Her ear caught the faint murmurings of their conversation. She drew her ear up to the speaker.

        &quot;…have been more than generous with my offer to purchase it from you, scavenger. I don&#39;t understand your resistance, nor will I tolerate it much longer.&quot;

        &quot;You can&#39;t imagine how much it would cost to purchase even a tiny sliver of a core, fella. Those prices are way out of the range of the likes of me. You&#39;re just looking—&quot;

        The figure slammed his balled fists against the countertop, causing Darnia to pull his hands away. &quot;Listen to me very closely, scum shopkeeper. I saw you steal away with a metal box like it was your greatest desire and I know very intimately how valuable the likes of even a sliver could be to the lowest tradesmen like yourself – valuable enough to hide it from me. The question is just how long will it stay valuable?&quot;

        The figure leaned across the counter, his stomach pressing up against the edge of it. His form completely covered all that was visible of Darnia while arm extended further across in the same direction.

Q-DO whirred.

        &quot;What do you mean you can&#39;t hear them anymore?&quot;

        Q-DO repeated the noise.

&quot;Well, we better close in!&quot; Tyra huffed, slightly pushing him with the back of her palm. Q-DO&#39;s eyestalk snapped back into his head and sounded like a match striking against sulfur as he rolled sideways, past the curtain.

The droid dived back behind the cover that the curtains provided and kept going, his torso rolling frantically in a zig-zag pattern with his eyestalk pointed directly at her, almost expectantly. When all she did was stare at her - unmoving, he erupted with high-pitched squeals as his eyestalk lengths, angled to look past her. The response earned a blink before she turned her body to look past the small gap between the wall and the curtain - not where they were observing from before. Dread overtook her.

A set of sharpened features, youthful and clean, had fixed their attention on the parting between the curtains, body fully turned, and posture fully straightened. His form was charged – like a leopard waiting for a moment to pounce on the unsuspecting. Tyra pinched the edge of the curtain against the wall to close off the gap that she had been looking through and shut her eyes with the same intensity as she tried to suck in a voiceless breath riddled with the onset of anxiety.

She no longer heard Q-DO behind her. A glance was all that it took to verify that he had hopelessly beaten her in the race to find a hiding place. The clacking sound of hard boots against the hard-stone floor left her stomach imploding in on itself as she slid behind an empty shelf. The swaying bottoms let her know that a mad dash was out of the question.

_So much for sticking with me through the hard parts._

She lowered herself to the ground, extending her arm behind her to serve as a brace. Her face settled behind the outermost column of the storage self. With half of her face covered by it, she couldn&#39;t make out so clearly how quickly the swaying of the curtains changed. Her stomach churned.

A set of curled, gloved fingers tucked around a ball of the curtain. Light seeped into the space just enough to leave Tyra worrying if she might black out from the overdose of adrenaline. She could hear Darnia&#39;s voice better with it slightly opened, passing off the noise as a rodent problem that, for some reason, have fallen in love with the smell of the oil kept back there. He mentioned the safe kept at the south end of the store. The curled fingers released the inner edge of the curtain. She allowed herself to breathe again as the curtains folded over the gaps and cast the familiar wave of darkness of the space. In the fading moment, she swore she saw Darnia&#39;s face pass over the opening and look directly at her.

She resumed her breathing a little too hard, wiping her forehead of the mucky dust-ridden beads of sweat. Pushing herself up from the back wall, Tyra made it over to the smaller gap between the outer edge of the curtain and the wall. From there, she made the gap bigger with a finger pulling on the cloth. Darnia and the figure had already covered half the distance to his office.

Tyra wanted to laugh.

_He seriously bought that what he heard were rodents? Perhaps there&#39;s something to be said for a shopkeeper&#39;s charisma after all!_

Darnia had his outer hand throwing his hand behind him at the counter even though he couldn&#39;t turn around or even dare to glance behind him. The gesture confused her until she realized that the box hadn&#39;t left its place on the shelf behind the counter – he had been stalling that entire time. It had been right underneath the nose of that thug the whole time and now Darnia wanted her to get it.

She swallowed, moving to the center parting in the curtain. She watched with the expectation that they&#39;d both disappear into the office. Darnia did. The thug didn&#39;t. Instead, he planted himself squarely in the doorframe with his back turned to the store proper. She bit her tongue at the first syllable of a curse. She knew better.

_He would have stopped what he was doing to reprimand me, regardless of that thug being here._

She parted the curtains and crossed the distance with as much grace as she could muster, rounding the large supports that kept the roof up and put something between her and the thug sharply glancing back as if he was convinced there was a ghost. She thought up a quick prayer of thanks to Ylupita and Galdora for the limitations of architecture. From there, she repeated her light-hearted seizure of the box from before. It tucked neatly underneath her arm – too neatly. She shook the feeling off and began the track to where she started from, following the same path around the large column. She tried to keep up the same speed but as she rounded the halfway point, her movement ceased on cue with the eruption of footsteps heading straight for the counter. Tyra pressed the small of her back against the curve of the smooth pillar, her body facing the front window of the shop. She only just now realized that Ylupita had already descended into her slumber and her sister was soon to join, casting the bleeding orange rays of exhaustion.

&quot;I&#39;ve shown you the safe! I&#39;ve shown you every single one of those metal boxes that look like the ones you&#39;re talking about. I really don&#39;t know what to show you at this point.&quot; Darnia&#39;s hurried voice grew closer.

Tyra turned her head to glance back towards the edge of the countertop. The shoulder of thug dropped into view as he began pulling all the things resting on the shelves behind it, each object crashing against the stone floor overlapping with the sound of the one that came before.

Then silence.

The thug rose, standing profile to Tyra so he could face Darnia. &quot;I&#39;m tired of your games. You have a star shard. I want it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m telling you that I don&#39;t have it. You probably have me mixed up with a different shopkeeper you&#39;ve seen today.&quot; [INCOMPLETE]
