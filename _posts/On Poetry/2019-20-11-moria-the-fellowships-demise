Under cold and blackened mountain bases  
lay the vacant, wasted, dwarven spaces.  
Corpses scatter halls of chiseled stone,  
mixed with rusting iron and shattered bone.  

Ancient forges once alive with flames  
stand in empty chambers darkness claims.  
Silence kills the mighty song of clamors  
craftsmen made by bringing down their hammers.  

Time has stolen the splendor kings once wore.  
Gems and gold, they stored on swords they bore.  
Velvet carpets lay in shreds on broken floors.  
Only goblins pass the throne room doors.  

The drums. The drums. Dangers in the deep.  
Creatures flee from demons once asleep.  
They move. Steps they take become the drums.  
Goblins scream and leave their prey. It comes.  

Living fire has risen from its slumber.  
Nine now sprint away, their moments numbered.  
As the balrog follows those who flee,  
one is taken so eight can go free.
