Upon the wastes he dared to tread,  
in search of the choicest meal.  
For his own treasured love, not bread  
but just the freshest veal.  

To win her heart was his one goal,  
all with food and finest fair.  
Whatever the price, he’d pay the toll  
for his lover’s eye to bear.  

I could not let him have her heart  
for I had grown to love  
her, too. To think of us apart;  
To fail, would shame my God above.  

This woman’s love could not be shared  
between two men. The right  
to her must then be declared.  
And fight for her one might.  

So, through the snow I followed close,  
that man unaware of me.  
He tracked his pray wherever it rose.  
I never let him be.  

Not far ahead I let him reach,  
though craftily he snuck.  
I let him find an elk with each  
gentle, flowering buck.  

When he had made his last decision,  
I raised my rifle.  
He aimed his gun with such precision.  
The animal, an eyeful.  

Soon, the buck rose its head to see  
the head of the hunter.  
It primed its legs to flee  
before it was forced into slumber.  

The craft of fire lit up the night.  
Two shots fired together.  
The two prey fell with little fight,  
and braced the freezing snow.  

“The snow will hide the signs to scan  
that blood was shed for love’s sake.”  
I stood before the dying man  
to find him still awake.  

“In my last moments, tell me why  
you acted out this crime.”  
“It’s done so she cannot deny  
that she’ll love me in due time.”
