The haze of twilight calls for me to come  
and keep my watch until the signal from  

the brighter fire. So high, I stay above  
and give the world below my rays of love.  

I sing a lullaby throughout the night  
and you pretend that I’m not worth the light.  

No tribute paid for what I give to you.  
The sacrifices I make are far too few  

and they cannot compete against the sun.  
His rise reminds me that the day has won.  

I glow in sorrow, scorning the far fire.  
You do not try to hear the silent choir  

but hide your heads until I fall asleep.  
Those nights in which you only weep,  

Above, I make my prayers to you known.  
I shine into your tears, allow my own  

to fall as rain. “Alone,” you say, “and lost!”  
And yet, I mourn with you. “Forget the cost!”  

Your pain becomes each surface crater.  
With all the souls that suffer, I waiver.  

The darkness haunting them remains unchecked.  
They miss so much because of my neglect.
