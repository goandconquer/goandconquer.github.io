We are but children on this pleasant earth.  
We play in mud and climb in trees to see  
how high up we can find and test our worth.  
A moment spent in nature makes us free.  

We grow to build, to shape, create a world  
of our own thoughts. We make castles out  
of sand and clay. A cardboard box thatâ€™s whirled  
to the ocean or the depths of space. A story about   

the youngest heroes they have ever seen.  
The stories composed during summer time  
become the works that writers base each scene  
on. Tales that carry strings of childhood rhyme.  

These worlds could touch the lives of people for  
ever. They have the chance to find away  
to the shelves of readers, dreamers, writers and more.  
A parent reads our dreams at end of the day.
