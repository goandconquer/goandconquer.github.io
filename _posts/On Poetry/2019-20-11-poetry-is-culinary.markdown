These words are bitter herbs when tasted alone.  
They pinch and burn the mouths of untrained souls.  
Unlike a master who, through trial, has grown  
by learning herbs are means of reaching his goals.  

The novice must partake of the master’s dish  
to understand the need for training.  
The artful craves his passion and does not wish  
to see his efforts fail or heart refraining.  

Instead, the common meal becomes his life,  
his basic unit shared between the crafts.  
The common line, the poet’s chosen knife,  
the masterpiece that’s hidden in the draft.  

By time and trial, the sour becomes savored.  
The art is made by tested will and thought.  
The chef and poet see why they labored  
and offer others what they have sought.
