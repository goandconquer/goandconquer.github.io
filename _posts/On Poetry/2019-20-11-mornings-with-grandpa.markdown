I always liked it when we got to that day.  
No rush, no plans, just quiet and peace.  
The song of birds would never cease,  
even when we had pulled up to the driveway.  

We’d get there after dark and spend the night,  
My mom would lay some blankets on the floor.  
It never bothered me. I didn’t want more.  
I’d stay awake and listen until the light.  

The first to wake and see the sun  
that’d pour in through the window pane.  
I’d sneak away until my brother came.  
And once we left the room, we’d run  

and see my grandpa siting there.  
He’d greet us, call us with a smile.  
He’d make us breakfast while  
We read the news and sat in his chair.  

A bow of sugar, milk and oats  
along with fresh slices of fruit.  
And after that, he’d tie the strings of each boot.  
and let me put on his own raincoat.  

We’d pick off peaches from the tree, unpeeled.  
Exploring every part, and seeing every sight,  
we’d stay out there until we’d climbed the heights.  
And there was nothing better than grandpa’s field.
