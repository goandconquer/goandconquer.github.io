# Starbound

We stand as children upon pleasant earth.
we fall when we see dreams shine in our sky.
Such sights bleed hearts and lessen our small birth
and so we fight for a chance to be in so high.

We leave so quickly the homes we so knew.
Store away the things long we loved and cherished
and whisper names of things quite big, brand new
we pray to God so we do not perish.

In the darkness, fragile, alone and lost,
we grope about frantic and so formless.
We realize soon when we count the many costs,
the pains we bear and tears that carry our stress.

We soon find a brighter, fuller night light.
The soul of man long lost and love endowed
our cheers, our hopes that we make loud just might
send our lives beyond thoughts steer us Starbound.
