            <h1>A treasure trove of terrible stories!</h1>
            
            <p>Since I'm making the bold claim of being an author, I should have something to show for it, right? Here, you'll find a breakdown of each story that I felt shouldn't be doomed to a fate of sitting in a folder buried within folders. These deserve just a little bit of light. I'm always looking for feedback for improvement. Hell, if you just want to send me hate mail, that's cool, too, since it tells me that you bothered to read enough of it to hate it!</p>
            
            <p>Below, you'll find the name of the story, which conveniently is linked to a .pdf extension of the story for ease of viewing. Underneath each title will be a small teaser for what the story is about.</p>
            
            <h2>FICTION</h2>
            
            <a href="Assets/Stories/Hello,%20California%20-%20Public%20Draft.pdf"><h3>Hello, California</h3></a>
            
            <p>A husband makes a decision without telling his wife that changes life for their family and forces them to go on the road trip of a lifetime to California.</p>
            
            <a href="Assets/Stories/Welcome%20to%20Argos%20-%20Public%20Draft.pdf"><h3>Welcome to ARGOS</h3></a>
            
            <p>A found-form style of litature detailing a totally exciting Terms and Service document regarding the use of a technological full-dive machine which is tailored to treating unhealthy habits and addictions.</p>
            
            <a href="Assets/Stories/She%20Led%20Him%20Home%20-%20Public%20Draft.pdf"><h3>She Led Him Home</h3></a>
            
            <p>A work of modular design. That is, each element of the story, in this case, scene, is followed by another form of writing found in between to give it a juxtaposed feeling. In this case, a sargeant transferred to the European front after a tour in the African theatre must lead his squad of recruits through various situations while reflecting on the last letter he received from his lover.</p>
