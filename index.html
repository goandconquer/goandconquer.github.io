            <h1>Mustering the Mystifying Muses</h1>
            
            <p>Welcome to the homepage of my website! It's a pleasure to have you here. This is a landing pad for the colorful and misinformed diatribes of a computer-geek-turned-storyologist. Topics include programming, game development, creative writing, table-top RPGs and any other nerd-centric hobbies one might adopt. Often times, these items are left to gather dust just waiting for the right place to call home. I finally found the courage to create that place. While what you might find here isn't as flashy or sophisticated as other blogsites you've seen, I believe this place represents a crucial first step in establishing myself as a brand. Feel free to take a look around and browse what I have to offer. Don't worry, nothing here costs money or requires forced participation. </p>
            
            <h2>About</h2>
            
            <p>More personal information you might find interesting if you want to get a snapshot of who I am.</p>
            
            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            
            <p>A comprehensive list of novels, short stories, poems, and fanfiction. Most of the work is directly viewable via .pdf files.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a featured literary work:</p>
            
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            
            <p>This page specifically features primarily programming-oriented projects but also features anything else that doesn't fit underneath publishable literature.</p>
            
            <p>Here's a featured project:</p>
            
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            
            <p>You'll find specific information about how to best reach me. This page also includes links to popular social media not included in the quicklinks found at the bottom of the nativagional bar.</p>
            
            <h2>Journal</h2>
            
            <p>The home of my blog-related posts. The subject matter is extensive and entirely up to the whim of the essay-oriented muse, who is a fickle individual to say the least.</p>
